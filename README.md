# shiftMethod
In JavaScript, the pop() method is used to remove and return the last element from an array. If you want a method that behaves similarly but for the first element of the array, you can use the shift() method.
In this example:

    We start with an array called fruits containing four elements: 'apple', 'banana', 'cherry', and 'date'.

    We use the shift() method to remove and return the first element of the array, which is 'apple'. The shift() method mutates the original array by removing its first element.

    We store the removed element in the variable removedFruit.

    We then log the removed element, which will display 'apple'.

    Finally, we log the modified array, which now contains the remaining elements ('banana', 'cherry', 'date') after the first element has been removed.

So, in summary, the shift() method is similar to pop(), but it operates on the first element of an array instead of the last. It removes the first element and shifts all remaining elements one position to the left.
